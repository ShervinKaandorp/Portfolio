# In the future

In 2 years i will be at the end of my study. I have done my internship (preferably in virology), and will orient myself into what jobs are available. My passion is with virology and it would be fantastic to implement bioinformatics into my job. Still I don't wat to be behind a computer for 90 percent of the time but I want a job where lab work and bioinformatics are distributed equally. 

Before I will graduate I want to broaden myself into the world of Bioinformatics. I have done this in the workflows course of the Data Sciences for Biology minor by deepen myself into Python. After this course i want to continue working with R in my projects and my internship.
