> Personal information

Hello! I'm Shervin and I am a 21 year old Life Science student. As a young boy i was fascinated by the television series CSI which sparked my interest in labs and DNA. This lead me to choosing a study in which I can immerse myself in these interests. With this education I have broaden my knowledge about cell biology, DNA, Immunology, Hematology and several other areas of the medical biology. I was surprised by my interest in the Research in microbiology area specifically the virology field in which I want to have an internship in. I would like to combine this with my knowledge of data analysis which I learned in the minor Data Sciences for Biology.
