## Lesson 2

### Portfolio Assignment 2

- Look at your RStudio project that you created for the DAUR-II final assignment
- Rearrange your project according the Guerilla principles explained above
- Add README files to the datasets
- Use the {fs} package to share a screenshot of your folder tree in your portfolio, look at: for more info on how to use the {fs} package.


Since the DAUR-II final assignment isn't interesting to look at, I've decided to show the whole DAUR-II directory in the tree.
```{r}
fs::dir_tree(here::here("../DAUR2"))
```
