# A clean directory

A neat working directory is key for an agile workflow and therefore should be applied to all your projects. A technique to clean your working space has been described by the Guerilla Principles. In this part I have cleaned my working directory using the Guerilla Principle 2.

My working directory for the DAUR2 course (Institute For Life Sciences and Chemistry (ILC), Hogeschool Utrecht) can be seen here:

```{r}
fs::dir_tree(here::here("../DAUR2"))
```
